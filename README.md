# CheckBook
This is a rudimentary checkbook balancing program. It will read a line, which will contain either
the word "withdraw" or "deposit". The next line will contain the amount of the check or deposit.
After reading each pair of lines, the program should compute and print the new balance.

This was a school project which was oroginally written in JAVA and I have also created a version 
in Python. This program works on the command line and is file based.
